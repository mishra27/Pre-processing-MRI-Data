# Pre Processing T1-weighted MRI Data

## Freesurfer Processing
The first common step shared by all of the methods was that all the T1 weighted images from ADNI-2 were segmented using FreeSurfer [Fischl et al. (2002)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11832223/). Developed by the Laboratory for Computational Neuroimaging at the Athinoula A. Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging, FreeSurfer is a software package that is used for analysing and visualizing neuroimaging data.
